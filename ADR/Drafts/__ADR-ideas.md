Good starting ADRs:

- algorithms should be decoupled from the Graph
- algorithms should be floating point type agnostic
- testing: algorithm tests vs Node smoke tests
- testing: performance tests
- Nodes should be type agnostic (mostly completed this overhaul)
- creating documentation (should be code based?)
- leverage implicit type conversion and truncation for readability-
